# Multiple Linear Regression Analysis

This project demonstrates a multiple linear regression analysis using Python, focusing on predicting an index price based on interest rates and unemployment rates.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts the `index_price` based on two independent variables:
- `interest_rate`
- `unemployment_rate`

By analyzing historical data, the project demonstrates how changes in interest and unemployment rates can affect the index price.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:
- `interest_rate`: The interest rate for the given period.
- `unemployment_rate`: The unemployment rate for the given period.
- `index_price`: The index price that we aim to predict.
